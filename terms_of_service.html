    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <h2>RoadReady G1 Ontario App</h2>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <span class="placeholder">[Insert Date - e.g., October 26, 2023]</span></p>

    <p>Welcome to RoadReady G1 Ontario! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the RoadReady G1 Ontario mobile application (the "App") provided by <span class="placeholder">[Your Name / Your Company Name]</span> ("we," "us," or "our").</p>

    <p><strong>Please read these Terms carefully before using the App. By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</strong></p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Important Notice:</strong> This document is a legal agreement. It outlines your rights and responsibilities. The App is intended as a supplementary study tool and does not guarantee passing the official Ontario G1 knowledge test. Consult a legal professional for advice regarding these terms.</p>

    <h2>1. App Description and Purpose</h2>
    <p>The App provides study materials, practice questions, mock exams, and related features intended to help users prepare for the official Ontario G1 driver's knowledge test. The content provided is for educational and practice purposes only and is based on publicly available driver's handbooks and general driving knowledge.</p>
    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The App is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or representative of the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) or DriveTest. The official G1 test is administered solely by DriveTest centres. Passing quizzes or mock exams within this App does not guarantee you will pass the official G1 test.</p>

    <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymous Use:** You may use certain features of the App without creating a permanent account. In this case, an anonymous user ID will be generated by Firebase Authentication to save your progress locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Linked Accounts:** You have the option to create a permanent account or link your anonymous session using Email/Password, Google Sign-In, or Sign in with Apple. This allows for progress syncing and potentially accessing premium features.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Responsibility:** If you create a permanent account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials (password) and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. License to Use the App</h2>
    <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install, and use the App on a single mobile device that you own or control, solely for your personal, non-commercial use in preparing for the Ontario G1 test.</p>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Modify, copy, adapt, translate, or reverse engineer any portion of the App.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the App or its related systems or networks.</li>
        <li>Use the App for any illegal purpose or in violation of any local, provincial, national, or international law.</li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the operation of the App or the servers or networks used to make the App available.</li>
        <li>Remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices contained in the App.</li>
        <li>Use the App content for commercial purposes or public performance without our express written consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subscription:** Certain features, content levels, or functionalities within the App ("Premium Features") may require a paid subscription.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing:** Subscriptions are managed and billed through the third-party platform from which you downloaded the App (Apple App Store or Google Play Store). Your purchase will be subject to the applicable payment policy of that platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Management Service:** We use RevenueCat to manage subscription status and entitlements. RevenueCat processes entitlement information received from the app stores.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Renewal:** [Choose ONE and delete the other - VERY IMPORTANT to be accurate]</strong>
            <br><em>Option A (If subscriptions auto-renew):</em> Subscriptions may automatically renew unless you cancel them through your App Store or Google Play account settings at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.
            <br><em>Option B (If subscriptions do NOT auto-renew):</em> Subscriptions are for a fixed term and do not automatically renew. You will need to purchase a new subscription period to continue access after expiration.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellations:** You must cancel your subscription through your App Store or Google Play account settings. Deleting the App does not cancel your subscription.</li>
        <li><strong>No Refunds:** Generally, all purchases are final and non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or the policies of the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</li>
        <li><strong>Price Changes:** We reserve the right to change subscription prices. We will provide reasonable notice of any price changes, typically through the app stores.</li>
