    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>RoadReady G1 Ontario App</h2>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <span class="placeholder">REPLACE_WITH_EFFECTIVE_DATE (e.g., August 01, 2024)</span></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <span class="placeholder">Your Company/Developer Name</span> ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects your information when you use the RoadReady G1 Ontario mobile application (the "App"). Please read this policy carefully.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>We collect different types of information depending on how you interact with the App:</p>

    <h3>A. Information Collected for Anonymous Use:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymous User ID:</strong> If you use the App without creating a permanent account ("Guest Mode"), Firebase Authentication generates a temporary, unique anonymous user identifier (UID).</li>
        <li><strong>Local Progress Data:</strong> We store your quiz progress (answers given, scores), chapter completion status, last accessed content (chapter/level), study streak data, mock exam attempts, favorited questions, list of incorrectly answered questions, and app preferences (like theme, language, audio settings) locally on your device using SharedPreferences (or equivalent device storage).</li>
        <li><p class="note">This local data is associated with your anonymous UID but is not directly linked to your personal identity by us unless you choose to link your account. If you uninstall the App or clear its data before linking, this anonymous data will likely be lost.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Information Collected When You Create or Link an Account:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase Authentication Data:</strong> When you sign up or link your anonymous account using Email/Password, Google Sign-In, or Sign in with Apple, we collect and store the following via Firebase Authentication:
            <ul>
                <li>A permanent, unique Firebase User ID (UID).</li>
                <li>If using Email/Password: Your provided email address.</li>
                <li>If using Google Sign-In: Information authorized by you through Google, which may include your name, email address, and Google User ID.</li>
                <li>If using Sign in with Apple: Information authorized by you through Apple, which may include your name and email address (this might be a private relay address provided by Apple).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Synced Account Information and Locally Stored Progress Data:</strong> When you create or log into a permanent account in the RoadReady G1 Ontario application (e.g., by signing up with email and password, or using Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In), certain account-specific information, primarily your <strong>premium subscription status</strong> (including active status, subscription type, and expiration date if applicable) and your account type (anonymous or permanent), is associated with your unique Firebase User ID (UID) and stored securely using Google's Firebase services like Firebase Firestore. This synchronization of premium status is essential for providing consistent access to premium features across different devices where you are logged in with the same permanent account. However, the majority of your application usage data, detailed learning progress, and personalized settings—such as which study chapters you have read or completed, your answers to quiz questions, scores achieved on practice quizzes, quiz attempt history, questions marked as "favorite," logs of incorrectly answered questions for the "Review Mistakes" feature, mock exam attempt history, your daily study streak, and app preferences like selected theme, audio narration speed, repeat count settings, and preferred interface language—are stored <strong>locally on the specific device you are using</strong>. This locally stored data is managed by the application on your device and is not automatically synced to our servers or across your other devices. Consequently, if you uninstall the application or use it on multiple devices, this local progress and settings data will generally not transfer, with the exception of your premium subscription status. We are continually working to improve our services, and our data storage and synchronization practices may evolve; any significant changes will be updated in this Privacy Policy.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Information Collected for Premium Subscriptions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Purchase & Entitlement Data (via RevenueCat):</strong> If you purchase a premium subscription, the transaction is processed by the relevant app store (Apple App Store or Google Play Store). We use RevenueCat, a third-party service, to manage subscriptions and verify entitlements.
            <ul>
                <li>We <strong>do not</strong> receive or store your credit card number or other sensitive payment details.</li>
                <li>RevenueCat receives purchase confirmation from the app store and associates it with your current Firebase User ID (which we provide to RevenueCat via their SDK's `logIn` function).</li>
                <li>We receive information from RevenueCat about your subscription status (e.g., whether the "premium" entitlement is active) and potentially the expiration date of your subscription. This allows us to unlock premium features within the App for your account.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Automatically Collected Technical Information:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Service Providers' Data Collection:</strong> Our integrated third-party services (Firebase, RevenueCat, Google Play Services, Apple Services) automatically collect certain technical data required for their operation and for app improvement. This may include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Operating system type and version, device model, application version, screen resolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Potentially resettable device identifiers (like Advertising ID, if used by Firebase Analytics) or vendor identifiers. Firebase Authentication uses instance IDs for service operation.</li>
                <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Used by services for functionality like region detection, service delivery, security, and fraud prevention.</li>
                <li><strong>Crash and Performance Data:</strong> If you experience a crash, anonymized or pseudonymized information about the crash event (device state, app version, stack trace) may be collected by Firebase Crashlytics (if enabled by us) to help us diagnose and fix issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> Anonymized or aggregated data about how you interact with the App (e.g., screens visited, features used, session length) may be collected by Firebase Analytics (if enabled by us) to help us understand usage patterns and improve the App.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide and Operate the App:</strong> Delivering core functionality, saving your progress locally, managing study plans, offering quizzes and mock exams.</li>
        <li><strong>To Manage Your Account:</strong> Authenticating you (anonymously or via linked account), linking anonymous progress to permanent accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>To Provide Premium Features:</strong> Verifying your subscription status via RevenueCat and unlocking corresponding content and features.</li>
        <li><strong>To Personalize Your Experience:</strong> Remembering your preferences like language, theme, and audio settings, which are stored locally.</li>
        <li><strong>To Sync Premium Access (for Linked Accounts):</strong> Allowing you to access your premium features if you log in on another device with the same permanent account. Other study progress and scores are stored locally on each device.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> Analyzing usage patterns (if analytics are enabled), identifying popular features, diagnosing crashes and performance issues (if crash reporting is enabled), and making enhancements.</li>
        <li><strong>To Communicate With You:</strong> Sending essential service communications (like password reset emails) or responding to your support requests.</li>
        <li><strong>For Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> Protecting the integrity of the App and user accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> Fulfilling legal or regulatory requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>

    <p>We value your privacy and do not sell your personal information to third parties. We only share information under the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>With Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We rely on trusted third-party companies to perform essential functions. We only share the information necessary for them to provide their services:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google (Firebase):</strong> Provides authentication, cloud database (Firestore for premium status), potentially analytics, and crash reporting services. Google has its own privacy policies governing its data use. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Manages subscription processing and entitlement verification. See <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple / Google:</strong> Process in-app purchases and provide authentication services (Sign in with Apple/Google). See <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the App, protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public, or protect against legal liability.</li>
        <li><strong>In Case of Business Transfer:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>

    <p>We rely on the security measures implemented by our chosen service providers (Firebase, RevenueCat, Apple, Google) which typically include measures like encryption of data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest. We implement reasonable administrative and technical safeguards within the App itself where applicable (e.g., secure handling of authentication tokens).</p>
    <p>However, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information transmitted to or stored by us or our service providers.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymous Data:</strong> Locally stored progress data associated with an anonymous UID is retained on your device until you clear the app's data, uninstall the App, or link the account. If linked, it becomes associated with your permanent UID, but the progress data itself remains local to the device where it was generated unless explicitly synced by future features.</li>
        <li><strong>Permanent Account Data:</strong> Information linked to your permanent Firebase UID (such as your <strong>premium entitlement status</strong> via RevenueCat, which is associated with data in Firebase Firestore) is retained as long as your account remains active or as necessary to provide the service, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or comply with legal obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Data:</strong> Subscription status managed by RevenueCat is retained according to their policies and linked to your UID.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Retention periods for automatically collected technical data are determined by our third-party service providers according to their respective policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Privacy Choices and Rights</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> You can typically access and update certain account information (e.g., password for email accounts) through the App's settings or via the authentication provider (Google/Apple).</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> You can manage or cancel your premium subscription directly through your Apple App Store or Google Play Store account settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Access, Correction, Deletion:</strong> Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of the personal information associated with your permanent account stored in our Firebase database (which primarily includes authentication details and premium status information). To make such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hadeedzahi@gmail.com"><span class="placeholder">your.contact.email@example.com</span></a>. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable law. Please note that deleting your Firebase account is irreversible and will result in the loss of access to synced premium features tied to that account UID, and may make locally stored progress on devices inaccessible if you cannot log in. We may need to retain certain residual information for backup, archival, fraud prevention, or legal compliance purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymous and Local Data:</strong> As most progress data is stored locally on your device, we generally cannot access, modify, or delete it remotely. You can typically clear this data by clearing the App's storage in your device settings or by uninstalling the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>

    <p>Our service providers, including Google (Firebase) and RevenueCat, operate globally. Your information may be transferred to, processed, and stored in countries outside of Canada, including the United States, where data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. By using the App, you consent to this transfer, processing, and storage of your information in these countries.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>The App is not directed to individuals under the age of 16 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the relevant age without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hadeedzahi@gmail.com"><span class="placeholder">your.contact.email@example.com</span></a>.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.</p>
