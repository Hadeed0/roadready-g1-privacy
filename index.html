    <h1>Privacy Policy - RoadReady G1 Ontario</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <span class="placeholder">[Date - e.g., October 26, 2023]</span> <!-- Replace [Date] --> </p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <span class="placeholder">[Your Name/Company Name]</span> <!-- Replace [Your Name/Company Name] --> ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our RoadReady G1 Ontario mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>We collect information to provide and improve the App, manage your account, and offer features like progress tracking and premium access. The types of information we collect include:</p>

    <h3>Account Information:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymous Usage:</strong> If you use the App without creating a permanent account, we use Firebase Authentication to generate a temporary anonymous user ID to save your progress locally (e.g., quiz scores, chapter completion, settings). This ID is not directly linked to your personal identity unless you choose to link your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Linked Accounts:</strong> If you choose to link your anonymous account or sign up for a permanent account using Email/Password, Google Sign-In, or Sign in with Apple, we collect the necessary information provided by you or the authentication provider:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> Your email address (for email/password), unique Firebase User ID (UID).</li>
                <li><strong>Google Sign-In:</strong> Information authorized by you via Google, potentially including your name, email address, and Google User ID. This is used to create or link your Firebase account.</li>
                <li><strong>Sign in with Apple:</strong> Information authorized by you via Apple, potentially including your name and email address (which may be a private relay address). This is used to create or link your Firebase account.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We store this account information securely using Firebase Authentication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>App Usage and Progress Data:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stored Locally & Potentially Synced (linked to your UID in Firestore):</strong> Quiz answers, quiz scores (last score, high score), chapter completion status, last read chapter, last visited quiz level, study streak data, mock exam history, favorited questions, incorrect answers list, language preference, theme preference, audio playback settings (speed, repeat count). This data is stored against your Firebase User ID (anonymous or permanent) in Firebase Firestore to provide features like progress tracking and review modes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subscription and Purchase Information:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Managed by RevenueCat & App Stores:</strong> If you purchase a premium subscription, the purchase process is handled by the respective app store (Apple App Store or Google Play Store) and our subscription management provider, RevenueCat. We <strong>do not</strong> directly collect or store your credit card or payment details.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat Data:</strong> RevenueCat receives your purchase information from the app store and associates it with your current Firebase User ID (provided via <code>Purchases.logIn</code>). We receive entitlement status (e.g., whether "premium" is active) and potentially subscription expiration dates from RevenueCat to unlock premium features in the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Device and Technical Information (Collected by Third-Party Services):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Our third-party service providers (Firebase, RevenueCat, Google Play Services, Apple Services) may automatically collect certain technical information necessary for the App's functionality, security, and improvement. This can include:
            <ul>
                <li>Device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID, device ID for push notifications if implemented).</li>
                <li>IP address (used for general location, fraud prevention, service delivery).</li>
                <li>Operating system version, device model, app version.</li>
                <li>Crash logs and performance data (e.g., via Firebase Crashlytics/Performance Monitoring, if used).</li>
                <li>General usage analytics (e.g., screens visited, features used, session duration via Firebase Analytics, if used) often in an aggregated or anonymized form.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the App's features (e.g., saving progress, unlocking premium content).</li>
        <li>To authenticate you and manage your account (anonymous or permanent).</li>
        <li>To process and manage your premium subscription status via RevenueCat.</li>
        <li>To synchronize your progress across devices if you use a linked, permanent account.</li>
        <li>To personalize your experience (e.g., theme, language, audio settings).</li>
        <li>To analyze app usage, identify trends, diagnose problems, and improve the App's performance and features.</li>
        <li>To communicate with you, such as sending password reset emails or responding to support requests.</li>
        <li>To ensure the security of the App and prevent fraud.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We share information with third-party service providers who help us operate the App:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google (Firebase):</strong> For authentication, database (Firestore), potentially analytics and crash reporting. (See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For managing subscriptions and checking entitlements. (See <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Apple / Google:</strong> For processing payments and authentication via their respective platforms. (See <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>

    <p>We rely on the security measures implemented by our service providers (Firebase, RevenueCat, Apple, Google) to protect your data. These typically include encryption for data in transit and at rest. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

    <p>We retain your account information and associated progress data as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the App's services. Anonymous progress data is tied to the anonymous user ID and may be lost if the App is uninstalled or data is cleared before linking to a permanent account. We may retain certain information for longer periods if required by law or for legitimate business purposes like resolving disputes or enforcing our agreements.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Privacy Rights</h2>

    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can typically manage your linked account information (e.g., password) through the App or the relevant provider (Google/Apple).</li>
        <li>You can manage your subscription through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</li>
        <li>If you wish to request deletion of your account and associated data stored in our Firebase database, please contact us at <a href="mailto:[Your Contact Email]"><span class="placeholder">[Your Contact Email]</span></a> <!-- Replace [Your Contact Email] -->. Please note that deleting your account is irreversible and will remove your progress and premium status. We may need to retain certain information for legal or operational reasons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:[Your Contact Email]"><span class="placeholder">[Your Contact Email]</span></a> <!-- Replace [Your Contact Email] --> so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
